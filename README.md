My name is Gurveer Girn and I a second-year Co -op Computer Science student at Toronto Metropolitan University, I am highly driven by a passion for programming, software engineering, and computational problem-solving. I am interested in concepts related to optimizing algorithms, exploring data structures, and developing efficient, scalable software solutions. I am proficient in Python, Java, JavaScript, SQL, C++, and C, and I enjoy applying these languages to solve challenging problems and build practical applications.

I am currently seeking Co-op opportunities to apply my technical expertise and problem-solving skills to real-world software development challenges. I am eager to further develop my skills and gain hands-on experience while making meaningful contributions to the tech industry.
